## Project 1: - Image stitching to create panoramic photographs
In this project, I crafted panoramic views using image stitching. I focused on achieving a seamless result by using feature matching and detection techniques. Exploring advanced algorithms, I identified and aligned distinct features across multiple images. Through meticulous feature matching, I ensured accurate alignment and cultivated high-quality panoramas, maintaining visual fluidity. This work contributes to the academic discourse on image stitching, showcasing the effectiveness of feature-based techniques for a unified and aesthetically pleasing panoramic composition.ðŸ“¸

## Project 2: - Object Detection Using YoLo - Nas
In this project I've leveraged the power of the YOLONas (You Only Look Once Neural Architecture Search) model to create a user-friendly Streamlit application. YOLONas is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that combines the efficiency of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework with the flexibility of neural architecture search, allowing for optimized model performance across a variety of hardware and deployment scenarios.
In this project, users can upload either a video or an image, and the YOLONas model will detect and classify objects in real-time. The Streamlit app provides a seamless interface, allowing users to easily interact with the object detection functionality. The demo video showcases the application in action, highlighting the model's ability to accurately identify and localize various objects within the input media.

By integrating YOLONas into a Streamlit-based application, I've created a powerful and accessible tool for object detection tasks. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or simply someone interested in computer vision, this project offers a compelling example of how cutting-edge deep learning techniques can be brought to life in a user-friendly and interactive manner.
I encourage you to explore the demo video, dive into the project's code, and consider how you might leverage this technology in your own applications. If you have any questions or feedback, feel free to reach out. I'm excited to share this project with the community and see how it can be further developed and applied.
