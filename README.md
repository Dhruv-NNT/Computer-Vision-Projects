In this project, I crafted panoramic views using image stitching. I focused on achieving a seamless result by using feature matching and detection techniques. Exploring advanced algorithms, I identified and aligned distinct features across multiple images. Through meticulous feature matching, I ensured accurate alignment and cultivated high-quality panoramas, maintaining visual fluidity. This work contributes to the academic discourse on image stitching, showcasing the effectiveness of feature-based techniques for a unified and aesthetically pleasing panoramic composition.ðŸ“¸
