## üñºÔ∏è‚ú®üîÑ Image-Image-Translation Using CycleGANs

### Overview

This project explores the use of Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs) for unpaired image-to-image translation. The focus is on translating images from one domain to another without the need for paired training examples.

### Key Features

- **Unpaired Image Translation**: Translate images between different domains without paired training data.
- **Cycle Consistency Loss**: Ensures that translated images can be mapped back to the original domain.
- **Adversarial Training**: Uses GANs to generate realistic images in the target domain.

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüì∑ Object Detection Using YOLO-NAS

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a computer vision interface using Streamlit in Python for real-time object detection. It utilizes the YOLO NAS (You Only Look Once - Neural Architecture Search) object detection model, which is known for its efficiency and accuracy.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Perform object detection on images and videos in real-time.
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly web interface for uploading images and videos, and viewing detection results.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes YOLO NAS for precise object detection with optimized network architecture.

## üì∏ Panoramic Image Stitching Project

### Overview

This project explores the process of combining multiple photographic images with overlapping fields of view to produce a segmented panorama or high-resolution image using homography. 

### Key Features

- **Feature Detection using SIFT**: Identifies distinctive points or regions in the images.
- **Feature Matching**: Matches features between images using brute force and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Homography and Image Blending**: Aligns and blends multiple images to create a seamless panorama.

## üîç Histogram Equalization Assignment

### Overview

Histogram Equalization (HE) is a fundamental image processing technique used to enhance the contrast of images. This project evaluates several HE methods, including Global HE, Adaptive HE, and Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE).

### Key Features

- **Global Histogram Equalization**: Enhances the global contrast of an image.
- **Adaptive Histogram Equalization**: Enhances local contrast by dividing the image into smaller regions.
- **Contrast-Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE)**: Limits the contrast enhancement to avoid noise amplification.
